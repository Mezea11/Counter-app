# This project is a simple app that is designed to count the number of people that board a train.

It can count from 0 to your desired number and then push it into an element where it saves the value. It can take several
entries so you can keep a history of the amount of people that have boarded. It also has a reset function that removes any history
and wipes the counter clean.
